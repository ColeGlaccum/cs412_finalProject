To run the longest path commands, you just need to do "python -m cs412_longestpath_exact.py" in the terminal
Additionally, test case 1000 is the one that takes more than 20 minutes to run. When running the test casees script,
it increments from 1 to 10 to 100 and then 1000 so that test would run sooner than expected.

The problem is important in solving the critical path in infastructure where the longest sequence of tasks needs to be found that could effect the completion or progress of other tasks in the future
